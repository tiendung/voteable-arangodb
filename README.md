# Voteable ArangoDB

Implement up / down voting solutions in Foxx using both embedded arrays and edgeCollection and compare pros and cons of them. 

Those two voting algorithms are implemented as `embedVote` function and `edgeVote` function in `models/voting.js`

**TODO**
 * Add unit tests to ensure correctness of `embedVote` and `edgeVote`
 * Create HTTP APIs to do to test Foxx performance and stability in real-life situations
 * Test performance of `embedVote` vs `edgeVote` to see advantage and trade-off of both methods
 * Re-implement `embedVote` and/or `edgeVote` in node.js + ArangoDB to compare performance between Foxx and node.js + db adapter
 * Re-implement `embedVote` and/or `edgeVote` in node.js + MongoDB to compare performance among node.js + ArangoDB, Foxx + ArangoDB and node.js + MongoDB

### embedVote
`embedVote` uses `upVoterIds` and `downVoterIds` to store vote data in-side the voteableObject so it can 
do voting and return tabulated data with-in single db query. Should be more efficient when number of votes per voteableObject is around hundereds or few thounsands? (need to do performance tests to find out)

**PROS**
 * Do voting in only ONE db query
 * No need to store additional tabulated data fields (upVotesCount, downVotesCount, totalVotePoint) inside voteableObject

**CONS**
 * Need to create indexes `upVoterIds` and `downVoterIds` for every voteableCollections and do multiple queries or combined AQL query in order to find out all voteableObjects a user voted before
 * Cannot store history data like votedAt timestamp
 * Cannot use graph alorithm to do recommendation. For example: show me few articles that are got most of up vote from my friends

### edgeVote
`edgeVote` use `votes` egdgeCollection to store vote data and database transaction to create / update votes and update/query tabulated data store inside voteableObject to speed-up

**PROS**
 * Find out all voteableObjects a user voted is much easier
 * Can store history data like votedAt timestamp
 * Can use graph alorithm to do recommendation. For example: show me few articles that are got most of up vote from my friends

**CONS**
 * Need to store additional tabulated data fields (upVotesCount, downVotesCount, totalVotePoint) inside voteableObject
 * Need to use transaction to ensure data consistency while create/update `voteObject` and update tabulated data in voteableObject
 

### Usage example

```js
// extracted from scripts/setups.js

var user1 = db.users.save({name: 'user1'});
var user2 = db.users.save({name: 'user2'});
var user3 = db.users.save({name: 'user3'});
var article1 = db.articles.save({title: 'article1'});
var article2 = db.articles.save({title: 'article2'});

var voting = require('../models/voting');

voting.embedVoteUp(user1._id, article1._id);
voting.embedVoteDown(user1._id, article1._id);
voting.embedVoteUp(user2._id, article1._id);
voting.embedVoteDown(user3._id, article1._id);

voting.edgeVoteUp(user1._id, article2._id);
voting.edgeVoteDown(user1._id, article2._id);
voting.edgeVoteUp(user2._id, article2._id);
voting.edgeVoteDown(user3._id, article2._id);
```

## Install ArangoDB and create development and test databases

Download [ArangoDB 3.0.3 for MacOSX](https://www.arangodb.com/repositories/MacOSX-10.8/x86_64/ArangoDB-3.0.3-CLI-MacOS-10.8-x86_64.dmg)

Copy `ArangoDB-CLI.app` to `/Applications` (open .dmg in Finder)

Run `ArangoDB-CLI.app` for the first time to start `arangod` in `Terminal`
May need to install openssl in order to run `arangod`
```bash
brew install openssl
```

Open Web Interface at http://localhost:8529

* `username`: *root*
* `password`:
* Then select db `_system` or press enter
* Click `DATABASES` > `Add Database` > enter **voteable_development** to `Name*:` > click `Create`
* Repeat above step to create **lxcd_test**
* Click `DB:_SYSTEM` at the top-right conner, click on drop down then select `voteable_development`
* Click `Select DB: voteable_development` or press enter


## Link source code to Arango Foxx app
Link source code to `voteable_development` database's `voteable` Foxx app so you don't have to reploy everytime you change your code.

```bash
mkdir /Applications/ArangoDB-CLI.app/Contents/MacOS/opt/arangodb/var/lib/arangodb3-apps/_db/voteable_development/voteable
ln -s ~/src/voteable-arangodb /Applications/ArangoDB-CLI.app/Contents/MacOS/opt/arangodb/var/lib/arangodb3-apps/_db/voteable_development/voteable/APP
```

Setup `test` app in test database
```bash
mkdir /Applications/ArangoDB-CLI.app/Contents/MacOS/opt/arangodb/var/lib/arangodb3-apps/_db/voteable_test/voteable
ln -s ~/src/voteable-arangodb /Applications/ArangoDB-CLI.app/Contents/MacOS/opt/arangodb/var/lib/arangodb3-apps/_db/voteable_test/voteable/APP
```

*Restart the `arangod` to reflect the change by killing the `arangod` process if it's still running, then re-run `ArangoDB-CLI.app`*
```bash
ps aux | grep arangod
kill -2 arangod_pid
```

## Change to development mode and run setup script

```bash
# Set development mode
/Applications/ArangoDB-CLI.app/Contents/MacOS/foxx-manager development /voteable --server.database voteable_development --server.authentication false
# Remove data if exists
/Applications/ArangoDB-CLI.app/Contents/MacOS/foxx-manager teardown /voteable --server.database voteable_development --server.authentication false
# Setup database and seeding data
/Applications/ArangoDB-CLI.app/Contents/MacOS/foxx-manager setup /voteable --server.database voteable_development --server.authentication false
```

NOTE: Some-time the development mode app doesn't reflect code change immediately. You have to restart the app manually by running command
```bash
/Applications/ArangoDB-CLI.app/Contents/MacOS/foxx-manager development /voteable --server.database voteable_development --server.authentication false
# Or use pre-built script for short
./restartApps.sh
```


## The development app will reflect any code change

* Open http://localhost:8529/_db/voteable_development/voteable
* Do the code change
* Refresh the web page to reflect the change

## Logging and debug

ArangoDB's Foxx is JavaScript so just use `console.log()` to print out any information you want

Then view the log in the console
```bash
tail -1 -f /Applications/ArangoDB-CLI.app/Contents/MacOS/opt/arangodb/var/log/arangodb3/arangod.log
```

Or in ArangoDB web interface at http://localhost:8529/_db/voteable_development/_admin/aardvark/index.html#logs

`WARNING:` **As far as I know, there is neither debugging tool nor console for Foxx apps**

Print infor to the log file is the only way to see how your Foxx app code work internally.

## Testing, Testing, Testing ...

Run test script in the terminal whenever you want
```bash
./runTest.sh
```

**API Document**

Open `ArangoDB's swagger` at http://localhost:8529/_db/voteable_development/_admin/aardvark/index.html#service/%2Fvoteable
Then click on `API` tab
